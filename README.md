Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a system intended to help with driver training. The system is supposed to operate off of the cloud and designed for students to access from computers and mobile devices. It should offer training packages, practice tests, scheduling and keep up with DMV compliance updates.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I excelled when it came to the activity diagrams. I had a very easy time with those as opposed to the use case diagram. Activity diagrams take just a single use case and show how the use case actually works.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve my use case diagram. I think it should be organized more and easily able to identify which actors are using which use cases. In addition, I would add more extensions as I really got a better understanding of them towards the end of the course.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
After thoroughly reading the DriverPass intervew transcript I found what I believed to be the key requirements. Liam (the business owner), wanted to be able to track who makes changes which led to implementing RBA (role based access) so that not all users will have access to the same functions. My logging in activity diagram also transpired from being able to track who makes changes in the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Start off with the requirements. Then create visual diagrams to help understand the systems architecture and flow. I would take more user feedback in the future. Even though I believe what I create to be comprehensible, I want to ensure others also think so and if they don't then I would make the needed changes.
